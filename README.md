Virtual Assistant - "Chitti"
Project Overview:

This project showcases a virtual assistant, named "Chitti," designed to interact with users using speech recognition and speech synthesis. It provides a simple yet engaging interface where users can ask questions or give commands, and the assistant responds back using natural language processing capabilities.

Key Features:

Speech Recognition: The assistant listens to the userâ€™s voice input through a microphone, converting the spoken words into text.
Speech Synthesis: Based on the user input, the assistant responds with a human-like voice in Hindi or English, creating an interactive experience.
User Interface: A sleek and user-friendly web interface with a minimalist design. The page includes:
A welcoming message introducing "Chitti" as the virtual assistant.
A clickable microphone button to start interaction with the assistant.
Visual feedback with a GIF to indicate when the assistant is listening or speaking.
Responsive design for optimal use across all devices (desktops, tablets, and smartphones).
Technology Stack:

HTML: Structure and content of the web page.
CSS: Styling for the layout, including animations and responsive design to enhance user experience.
JavaScript: Implements the functionality for speech recognition and synthesis using the Web Speech API.
Voice Integration: The assistant can speak in multiple languages, including Hindi and English, and allows voice commands for more immersive interaction.
Possible Use Cases:

Personal Assistant: Users can ask for weather updates, reminders, or general information.
Voice-Based Interaction: Ideal for hands-free interaction in an educational or professional setting.
Accessibility: Helps users with disabilities by allowing voice-based interaction instead of typing.
